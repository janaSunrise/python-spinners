# Python spinners

A collection of interactive awesome loading spinners created in python 
for terminal base loading UI.

## How to run it?

You need to just use this simple command: `python -m app` and it shows 
a random spinner. 

You can also use `python -m app <n>`, where n is the number of iterations for the spinner. 
You can tweak the settings and configure it 
for more.

It can also be changed a lot, along with backgroung and foregrount colors.
It's being planned, will be implemented soon.
